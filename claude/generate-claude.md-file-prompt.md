Analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file following these principles:

1. Keep it under 300 lines total - focus on universally applicable information.
2. Cover the essentials: WHAT (tech stack, project structure), WHY (purpose), and HOW (build/test commands)
3. Use progressive disclosure: instead of including all instructions, create a brief index pointing to other markdown files in .claude/docs/ for specialized topics.
4. Assume I will use linters for code style - don't include formatting guidelines

Structure it as:
* Project overview
* Tech stack
* Key directories and their purpose
* Essential build/test commands
* Additional documentation files Claude should check when relevant

Additionally, extract patterns you observe into separate files:
.claude/docs/architectural_patterns.md - document the architectural patterns, design decisions, and conventions used
(e.g. dependency injection, state management, API design patterns). Make sure these are patterns that appear in 
multiple files. Reference these files in the CLAUDE.md's "Additional Documentation" section.
