We don't 


* I don't like the direction Apple has taken during the rein of Tim Cook. It's when Apple went from being an company of
  innovation to a fashion company. Burburry, Prada, cologne. iPhone is marketed as a status symbol more than it is
  for its features. Prices going up, you get less for paying more.
* Macbook Pro 2017 model sucked. I really think the 2016 MPB was the best. In 2017 they took away some of the nice
  touches with the lighting and instead gave you a really crappy keyboard that didn't feel as nice. I really think
  the 2011 generation of models had the best keyboards. 
  
  They had a little bit of a heavier feel to them, where in
  comparison the 2016's were a little flimpy. 2017 Macbook, the fact that USB-C was your ONLY option for connecting
  a peripheral was really upsetting. To do anything with it from plugging in a monitor to using an SD card
  required you to use an adapter. It felt almost like rather than designing that model around what the consumers would
  need, Apple gave it's users an "F-U, we're Apple and we're going to tell you how to use your computer".  
  Sharp edge on the vent made me feel like I was gonna cut myself every time I picked it up.
* MacBook Pro sucks
    - 
    - We don't even have a touchscreen on the Macbook Pro!
    - ARM processors - moving away from compatibility with the rest of the computing world. What are the implications
      for development? For writing server programs?

* Windows is getting better. Linux subsystem. Docker.
