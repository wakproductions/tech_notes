In this video I'm going to be reviewing several keyboards for Windows, from the perspective of a former Macbook Pro user. Prior to getting my first Macbook in 2013, I didn't think much about keyboard design. Most of the keyboards I've had experience with up until then were the standard issue kind you'd get with a desktop. But when I got my first Macbook, the quality of the keys were quite an upgrade. I really liked the feel of the scissor switches on that 2013 model. They provided a strong tactile bump, had great spacing between the keys, and had just the right amount of stiffness so that my fingers can feel around the keyboard without mistakenly activating a key. The backlight was also a nifty little feature which was new for the time.

I've stayed a loyal Mac user, all the way up until they introduced the 2017 model Macbook, which in my opinion is a piece of junk. I didn't like the butterfly switches because the short travel distance of the keys made it difficult to feel around the keyboard while typing, and other poorly designed additions like the touchbar I think make more of an inconvenience than a feature.




So this year for various reasons, I'm building a PC and want a high quality keyboard. Here are some of the options I'm going to be trying out.
 
The new trend in keyboards seems to be the mechanical switch design. So the first keyboard I'm going to be reviewing here will be...  



Apple scissor switch:
* Resistance to the keys, with a little bump. I also like the spaces between the keys. Like that. I guess it can get kind of tiring to use if I'm doing a lot of typing for an extended period of time. I'm usually programming and doing short bursts of typing, but someone who is writing a lot of paragraph type of text, may not like this sort of keyboard as much. When the CPU gets hot, the keys can get hot. Something really weird I notice with Macbooks is that I get this tingling, electrictrity like feeling on my fingers when the fan is going crazy and it warms up. Anybody else experience something like that before?
* Butterfly switches, I kept accidentally touching buttons on the touchbar, which is annoying. Screen lock.





I've been using the Macsince 2013, and when I got my first Macbook I was quite impressed with it's design.




It's been 3 months from when I shot the initial footage of this video. Over that time, I grew to really like the
feel of the keyboard with the Gateron Brown switches. I've adjusted to the weaker keystroke bump in comparison to the 
Mac, and now when I type on an old Macbook I feel like the keys are too heavy. The keyboard is kind of loud, but
it doesn't really bother me anymore. It not like I'm going to be taking my desktop to a quiet coffee shop anytime soon
anyway. Being able to change the backlight is an enjoyable nice to have feature that makes using the computer a little 
more fun.

Also, on the Artech wireless keyboard with the scissor switches... I've used it a few times since the original review
and I noticed that every once in a while it will send additional keystrokes, causing weird typos. 

So my favorite keyboard is now the mechanical one by a long shot. I don't miss typing on the Crapbook Pro at all, 
and Windows has dramatically improved since the last time I used it.
