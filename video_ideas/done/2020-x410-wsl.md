In this video, I'm going to show you how to run graphical Linux applications on your Windows 10 system using the Windows Subsystem for Linux and and a Windows application named  X410. We are going to be running our graphical application through a Linux program called the X11 Window System, which is a framework and protocol which Linux can use to build graphical interfaces. As X11 is just a set of standards maintained by the X.Org Foundation, we need software to implement this protocol, for which we will be using a program called XFCE.

In the first step, we need to go to the Windows store and purchase the X410 software. In case you didn't notice, the name X410 is short for X Windows Server for Windows 10. This is a program that will run in Windows, acting as a client, that connects to your Linux server and will render the GUI elements for whichever Linux program you're running. It's very similar to Remote Desktop. Now when we first open this program, it's going to present a blank screen, and that's because it doesn't have a Linux desktop environment to connect to yet. In order for us to have something to render, we need to install a program on our Linux server called XFCE. We can do that using the apt package manager.

When I first installed xfce and gave it a run, I ran into a "cannot render display error", and discovered that this was due to the defaults on Debian Linux. We need to enable an ssh_config option named X11 forwarding by setting it to true, then we need to install two modules, "xbase-clients" and "x-auth".  There's also another little catch when you're developing on WSL, it requires that you use its own internal IP address for connecting to the display. You can find the IP address to use by looking in the /etc/resolv.conf file. We need to export this to the display environment variable.

Now if we run `xfce4-session`, we should be able to return to the X410 application and see our X11 desktop GUI. From here, we can use this desktop to open and run any Linux GUI based application.
