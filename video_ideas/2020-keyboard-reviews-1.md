In this video I'm going to be reviewing several keyboards for Windows, from the perspective of a former Macbook Pro user. Prior to getting my first Macbook in 2013, I didn't think much about keyboard design. Most of the keyboards I've had experience with up until then were the standard issue kind you'd get with a desktop. The one exception being my Sony Viao, which had a pretty nice feel for a laptop at its time. But when I got my first Macbook, the quality of the keys were quite an upgrade. I really liked the feel of the scissor switches on that 2013 model. They provided a strong tactile bump, had great spacing between the keys, and had just the right amount of stiffness so that my fingers can feel around the keyboard without mistakenly activating a key. The backlight was also a nifty little feature which was new for the time.

I've stayed a loyal Mac user, all the way up until they introduced the 2017 model Macbook, which in my opinion is a piece of junk. I didn't like the butterfly switches because the short travel distance of the keys made it difficult to feel around the keyboard while typing, and other poorly designed additions like the touchbar I think make more of an inconvenience than a feature.

So this year I'm switching back to the PC, and the new trend in keyboards seems to be the mechanical switch design.  



Apple scissor switch:
* Resistance to the keys, with a little bump. I also like the spaces between the keys. Like that. I guess it can get kind of tiring to use if I'm doing a lot of typing for an extended period of time. I'm usually programming and doing short bursts of typing, but someone who is writing a lot of paragraph type of text, may not like this sort of keyboard as much. When the CPU gets hot, the keys can get hot. Something really weird I notice with Macbooks is that I get this tingling, electrictrity like feeling on my fingers when the fan is going crazy and it warms up. Anybody else experience something like that before?
* Butterfly switches, I kept accidentally touching buttons on the touchbar, which is annoying. Screen lock.





I've been using the Macsince 2013, and when I got my first Macbook I was quite impressed with it's design.
